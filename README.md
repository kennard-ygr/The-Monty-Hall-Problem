# The Monty Hall Problem Simulator
The Monty Hall Problem is a mathematical proof that somehow turns a 50/50 shot a winning a car into a 66% chance of winning a car. I intend to find that out by simulating 1 million runs (or however many I can without crashing my PC) of this Monty Hall game and seeing what the results show with my own eyes.

## Order of Events
- Place the car (pick one of the total doors)
- Pick 1 door (pick one of the total doors)
- Pick doors to eliminate (pick the door that was previously chosen and another door, either the correct door or a random door if the correct one was chosen)
- Pick to swap or stay (50/50 decision)
- Record win or loss
- Repeat a number of times

## Manually Set Items
- Number of doors to choose from (how does this affect the outcome)
- Number of runs to do
